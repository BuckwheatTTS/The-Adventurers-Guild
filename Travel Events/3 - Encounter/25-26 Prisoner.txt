25-26 Prisoner 

As the Warriors approach the crest of a hill, they hear the 
noise of armed men approaching. Taking cover, they watch as 
a band of swarthy mercenaries troops by dragging a wealthy 
merchant behind them.
 
The Warriors can either fight the mercenaries and free the 
prisoner, or let them pass unhindered. If the Warriors attack 
the mercenaries, rill 1D6 on the following table: 

1-2 The mercenaries drive the Warriors off, taking some of 
	their gold. Each Warrior loses 1D6x10 gold.
 
3-4 The Warriors kill the mercenaries after a long struggle, 
	but not quickly enough to prevent them slaughtering 
	the prisoner. The Warriors each find 1D6x20 gold if 
	they search the bodies. 

5-6 The Warriors best the mercenaries in a fierce fight, and 
	free the prisoner. He cannot travel very fast, and if the 
	Warriors take him with them he adds one week to 
	their journey time. Upon arriving at their destination, 
	he gives each Warrior 100 gold for rescuing him.
