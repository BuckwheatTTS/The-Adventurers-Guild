43-44 Dryads

In the shadowy depths of the forest, the Warriors encounter a 
group of Dryads who protect the area. They are easily 
provoked and the Warriors must be careful not to offend 
them. 

Each Warrior must roll 1D6 on the table below (the Elf 
Warrior, the Wardancer, and the Albion Druid may add +1 to 
their dice roll): 

1 The Dryads perceive your Warrior as a threat to the 
	forest and punish them accordingly. Your Warrior 
	must deduct -1 from their Starting Wounds score 
	permanently. 

2-3 Your Warrior offends the Dryads and is beatebn 
	senseless. Your Warrior -1 Strength until the end of 
	the next Adventure. 

4-5 Your Warrior befriends the Dryads and they are 
	allowed to pass through unharmed.
 
6 Your Warrior impresses the Dryads and is seen as an 
	ally of the forest. They gift your Warrior a healing 
	potion that when drunk will heal your Warrior back up 
	to full Wounds.
