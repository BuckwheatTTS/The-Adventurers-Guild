45-46 Traveller

Passing through a small forest the Warriors catch a whiff of 
the unmistakable smell of game cooked over an open fire. In a 
nearby clearing they find a traveller who invites the Warriors 
to join him for dinner. During the night, the traveller secretly 
places an item of Treasure in one of the Warrior’s pack. In the 
morning the traveller bids them all farewell and continues on 
his way. Draw a Warrior counter to determine which Warrior 
has the item and then roll 1D6 to determine what the item is. 
On a score of 1,2, or 3 it is an item of Dungeon Room 
Treasure. On a score of 4, 5 or 6 it is an item of Objective 
Room Treasure. 
 
 When the Warriors enter the next Settlement, the Watch 
are frisking as part of a search for missing items. The Warrior 
carrying the item from the traveller must roll 1D6 below:
 
1 The item your Warrior is carrying is confiscated as it 
	was recently stolen from a prominent noble. Your 
	Warrior is flogged in the town square and thrown into 
	jail. They are released after 7 days once they convince 
	the authorities of their innocence. 

2 The item your Warrior is carrying is confiscated as it 
	was reported stolen by a wealthy merchant. Your 
	Warrior spends 1D6 days in jail and fined 100 gold.
 
3-4 The Watch are not interested in any items your 
	Warrior is carrying and they are allowed entry. The 
	moment they set foot through the settlement gates, a 
	young knave discreetly lifts the item off of the Warrior 
	(discard it). The Warrior has been an unsuspecting 
	player in a smuggling ring that operates in the area.
 
5-6 The item your Warrior is carrying is not the item the 
	Watch is looking for and the puzzled Warrior may keep 
	the item for himself.
