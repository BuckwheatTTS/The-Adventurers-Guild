31-32 Merchants

The Warriors meet some date merchants on the road. The 
ravaged Warriors are more than glad to pay 10 gold each in 
exchange for some of the dates the merchants are selling, 
which they consume eagerly. Roll 1D6 for the Warriors: 

1-3 The Warriors’ heads begin to spin, and they drop one 
	by one. Paralysed stiff, the Warriors can do nothing 
	while the date merchants rob them blind. When the 
	Warriors come to, they find that half of their gold has 
	been stolen! Roll 2D6 for each Warrior. If the result is 
	double 1’s, the Warrior had a horribly allergic reaction 
	to the drug and they do not wake up. They are dead 
	and removed from the game.
   
4-6 The Warriors enjoy the dates, bid farewell to the 
	Merchants and each group moves on their way.
