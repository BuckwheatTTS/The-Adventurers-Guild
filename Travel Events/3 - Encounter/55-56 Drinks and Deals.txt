55-56 Drinks and Deals

During a brief interlude in the journey at a roadside inn, the 
Warriors have just agreed that the next drink really must be 
their last when another group of adventurous rogues arrive at 
the bar. Several rounds of drinks later, each member of the 
other group offers one of the Warriors a ‘blind trade’. Any item 
of theirs for any item of the Warriors.
 
If a Warrior accepts, discard one Treasure and roll 1D6 to 
see is given to them in exchange. If the score is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 
then the Warrior receives an item of Dungeon Room Treasure. 
If the dice roll is a 6, then the Warrior receives one item of 
Objective Room Treasure instead!
