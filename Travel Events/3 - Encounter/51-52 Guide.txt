51-52 Guide

A thin, wiry, and adventuring fellow approaches the Warriors 
and claims to be a local guide of the province and will show the 
Warriors to their destination, reducing their journey time by 
one week. If the Warriors take him on as their guide, they 
must each pay 1D6x20 gold. When the Warriors reach the 
Settlement, the guide disappears into a crowded market. Roll 
1D6 on the table below (make one roll for the entire group):
 
1-3 The Warriors notice that they are each missing an 
	item! One item of Treasure (determined randomly) has 
	been stolen by the guide during the past week!
 
4-6 The guide was actually a famous ranger from the area 
	and the local shopkeepers are impressed to see you 
	enter with him. Each Warrior may pick any one item 
	for sale they find in stock from a single Trader at the 
	Settlement and can buy it for half price!
