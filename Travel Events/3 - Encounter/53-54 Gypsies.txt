53-54 Gypsies

Drawn by the sounds of singing and dancing, the Warriors 
come upon a caravan of gypsies just as they are breaking 
camp. Coincidentally, the gypsies are heading to the same 
Settlement as the Warriors and suggest travelling together. If 
the Warriors refuse, they must each roll 1D6. If the roll is a 1, 
the Warrior has incurred thew wrath of the offended gypsies 
and must deduct -1 Luck permanently! 

If the Warriors allow the gypsies to travel with them, the 
Warriors lose valuable time and must add 1 week to their 
journey. When they arrive at the Settlement, they find their 
purses 1D6x50 gold lighter!
