11-12 Mystic

Near a fast-flowing brook the Warriors meet an old, blind 
hermit who claims to be a prophet. He reveals how to 
overcome a terrible fate that awaits the Warriors.
 
The next time any of the Warriors must roll for a 
Catastrophic Event, they may ignore the result and roll again. 
They must accept the outcome of the second roll.
