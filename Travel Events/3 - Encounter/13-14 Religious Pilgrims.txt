13-14 Relgious Pilgrims

Stopping to rest at a nearby river, the Warriors encounter a 
group of religious pilgrims who are aggressively passionate 
about their spiritual journey and turn out to be extremely 
persuasive speakers.
 
Each Warrior must roll 1D6 and add their Willpower. If the 
score is 7 or less, the Warrior is convinced to donate 2D6x100 
gold to their cause. If the Warrior does not have that amount, 
they give the pilgrims whatever gold they have.
