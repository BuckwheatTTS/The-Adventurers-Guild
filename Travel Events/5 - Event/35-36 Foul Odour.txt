35-36 Foul Odour

As the Warriors trudge through the brush, they become aware 
of a foul odour. Roll 1D6 on the following table to see what the 
cause of the odour is:
 
1-4 The Warriors come upon an empty village. Chaos 
	Warriors have murdered the inhabitants and dead 
	bodies lay strewn about. The lone survivor is a young 
	girl, drenched in blood. The Warriors must take her 
	with them to the next Settlement, adding one week to 
	their journey. 

5-6 The Warriors come upon a battlefield of defeated Orcs. 
	Rummaging through the bodies, each Warrior finds 
	1D6x20 gold.
