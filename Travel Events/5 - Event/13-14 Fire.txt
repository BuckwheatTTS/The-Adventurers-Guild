13-14 Fire

During the night a fire rages through the camp. The intensity 
of the blaze is such that it may turn the warriors’ gold to 
lumps of molten metal.  Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and consult 
the following table: 

1 Your Warrior’s gold is melted beyond recognition. It is 
	now only worth half its original value. 

2-5 Luckily, your Warrior’s gold wasn’t affected and they 
	are still as wealthy, or as poor, as they were before 
	the fire! 

6 Your Warrior’s gold is intact! In addition, as they 
	scramble in the blackened Earth to retrieve their 
	fortune, they find a long-buried gemstone worth 
	1D6x50 gold.
