55-56 Mage Battle

As the Warriors approach the outskirts of an abandoned 
village, they realize that they are encroaching upon the combat 
zone of two powerful and long-feuding mages!
 
The Warriors must either lose 1D3 weeks travel 
circumventing the conflict, or chance a dangerous crossing. 
Any Warrior attempting to cross the area must roll 2D6 below:
 
2 Caught within the maelstrom of arcane energies 
	unleashed by the battling wizards, the Warrior is torn 
	asunder by the unfettered force of the Winds of Magic. 
	They are quite dead. 

3 Weighed down by riches, the Warrior struggles to 
	move swiftly across the danger zone. Caught between 
	clouds of living lightning and wall of roiling magma, the 
	Warrior faces a harsh choice: be poor or be dead. 
	Abandoning 2D6x50 gold the Warrior is able to hasten 
	their escape and flees the battlefield unharmed. 

4-6 Struck by an errant blast from one of the mages the 
	Warrior, possessions and all, is turned into a toad until 
	the start of the next Adventure. They may do nothing 
	but lay low in the next Settlement (snuggled safely in 
	one of the other Warrior’s pocket) and reverts to 
	normal at the entrance of the next Dungeon. 

7+ With fireballs exploding around them and bolts of 
	lightning screaming overhead, the Warrior makes it 
	safely across the battlefield with only a few minor 
	burns and a huge sense of relief.
