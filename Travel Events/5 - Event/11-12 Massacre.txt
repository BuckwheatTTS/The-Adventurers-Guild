11-12 Massacre

The Warriors come across a burning wagon in a forest 
clearing. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the 
highest score recognizes the dying travellers as their blood kin. 
One of them is able to tell the Warriors who perpetrated the 
massacre. Roll 1D6: 

1 Goblins 4 Dark Elves 
2 Skaven 5 Chaos Warriors 
3 Orcs 6 Beastmen 
 
From now on, the Warrior whose kin have been slaughtered 
Hates the type of Monster (see the Psychology section of the 
Roleplay Book). Note this down on their Adventure Record 
sheet. Every time they kill one of these Monsters, this Warrior 
gains an extra 5 gold on top of the Monster’s Gold Value.
