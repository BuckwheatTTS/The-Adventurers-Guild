65-66 Fall

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score 
trips over a log and breaks their ankle. How embarrassing! 
Dragging them along slows the party down, adding two weeks 
to the journey. When the Warriors reach a Settlement, it costs 
the injured Warrior 30 gold to have their ankle healed.
