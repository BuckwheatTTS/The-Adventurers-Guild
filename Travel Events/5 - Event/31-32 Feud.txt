31-32 Feud

The Warriors are travelling in a war-torn area where two Lords 
have been feuding over land rights for the past few months.  
All the local smiths are busy forging weapons as each side 
prepares for battle whilst both lords have sent armed gangs to 
the roads in order to confiscate weapons and generate funds 
for their cause. Roll 1D6 for the group on the table below:
 
1-2 Each Warrior is ‘encouraged’ to contribute one item of 
	Treasure and half their gold to one of the Lords.
 
3-4 Each Warrior must ‘donate’ one Item of Treasure 
	(determined randomly) in support to one of the Lords.
 
5-6 The armed gangs are intimidated by the Warriors and 
	wisely decide not to bother them.
