43-44 Warrant

As the Warriors approach a make-shift militia checkpoint, they 
are surrounded by dozens of armed soldiers. The captain steps 
forward and points at one of the Warriors, shouting, “You are 
under arrest!” 

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior, with the lowest score being the 
target of the captain’s words. They are dragged away 
immediately. The other Warriors have two options: 

a) The Warriors can continue on their way without delay 
	in which case the jailed Warrior must pay 1D6x50 gold 
	in bribes (selling any Equipment or Treasure if 
	necessary) and may continue their journey to a 
	Settlement on their own. If the Warrior cannot pay, 
	they are held in a dank prison where they catch a 
	sickly fever. They are finally freed many weeks later 
	and can meet up with the other Warriors at the 
	entrance to the next Dungeon. Due to the fever, 
	however, they are -1 Toughness for the next 
	Adventure. 

b) The Warriors may bribe the captain into releasing their 
	comrade and letting them go on their way. The bribe 
	amounts to 150 gold from each of the remaining 
	Warriors.
