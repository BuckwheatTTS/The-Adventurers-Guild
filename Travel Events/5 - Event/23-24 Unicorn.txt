23-24 Unicorn

As the Warriors lay down their gear to rest and relax in a 
beautiful meadow, a beautiful unicorn runs past in the 
distance.
  
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and if the score is a 6, the Warrior 
catches a glimpse of this rare and extraordinary event. Each 
Warrior who sees the Unicorn is +1 Luck for the next 
Adventure.
