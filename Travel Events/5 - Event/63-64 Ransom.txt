63-64 Ransom

The Warriors come to the edge of a gully when a masked rider 
approaches from the other side. Mistaking the Warriors as 
representative of the local Baron, he demands that they toss 
over a ransom of 2D6x100 gold (he accepts items of Treasure 
of equal value) or he’ll kill the Baron’s daughter!
 
If the Warriors pay the ransom they must roll 1D6 on the 
table below: 

1-4 The masked rider grabs the gold and rides out of 
	sight… 

5-6 The masked rider grabs the gold and tells the Warriors 
	where they can find the Baron’s daughter alive and 
	well. When they reach the next Settlement, the Baron 
	is so thankful to have his daughter back safe and 
	sound that he pays the Warriors twice the amount 
	they paid the masked rider.  
 
If the Warriors do not pay the ransom, when they reach the 
next Settlement, they must roll 1D6 on the table below: 

1 The Warriors are arrested by the Baron after some 
	locals swear they saw the Warriors speaking with the 
	masked rider. When his daughter’s dead body appears 
	soon afterwards, the Baron has the Warriors beaten 
	viciously. They must each deduct -1D3 Wounds to 
	their Starting Wounds score permanently. The Baron’s 
	rage eventually cools but the Warriors are thrown out 
	of the Settlement and must proceed directly into the 
	next Adventure. 

2-3 The Warriors are accused of being accomplices and 
	are throw in jail for the next 1D6 days and fined 
	1D6x100 gold each (selling Equipment and items of 
	Treasure if necessary). 

4-6 The Warriors are accused of being accomplices and 
	are throw in jail for 1D3 days. The baron’s daughter is 
	found soon after and she exonerates the Warriors.
