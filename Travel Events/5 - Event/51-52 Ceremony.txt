51-52 Ceremony

The Warriors hear strange sounds from behind some large 
boulders and when they investigate they realise they have 
interrupted a sacred ceremony being held by a group of 
worshippers. Roll 1D6 to see the reaction of the worshippers:
 
1-4 The worshippers are furious that their ceremony has 
	been interrupted by outsiders. They began chanting a 
	curse upon the Warriors, driving them away from the 
	area. The next time each Warrior rolls a ‘6’ on a 1D6 
	roll, they must treat it as a ‘1’ instead. 

5-6 The worshippers are ecstatic to see the Warriors and 
	claim that their prayers have been answered! They 
	insist on presenting each Warrior an item of Dungeon 
	Room Treasure!
