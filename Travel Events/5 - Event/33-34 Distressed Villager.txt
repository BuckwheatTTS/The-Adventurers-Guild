33-34 Distressed Villager

The Warriors come upon a farmer from a nearby village who 
begs for the Warriors’ help in defending the village from an 
impending bandit attack. The Warriors cannot refuse such a 
noble cause and follow the man confidently back to the Village 
Elders to formulate a plan of defence. The Warriors’ journey is 
over, but the battle has just begun! Roll 1D6 on the following 
table:
 
1 The bandits are not to be trifled with! Their first attack 
	is devastating and the Warriors find themselves in full 
	retreat! Regretfully determining that the village is lost, 
	the Warriors have no other choice but to abandon the 
	poor villagers and immediately proceed to the next 
	Adventure. Because of the terrible defeat, each 
	Warrior is -1 Willpower during the next Adventure. 

2-3 The bandits are stronger than anticipated. The 
	Warriors eventually defeat them, but the village 
	suffers many losses. The Warriors each donate 
	1D6x50 per Battle-level gold to the villagers to help 
	pay for repairs to the village and proper burials for the 
	dead. 

4-6 The battle is glorious! With cunning strategy and 
	brave actions, the Warriors triumph over the bandits. 
	The cheering villagers regard the Warriors as heroes 
	for their efforts and offer them thanks. For the 
	duration of the Warriors’ stay, all items are reduced to 
	half price and they pay no Living Expenses!
