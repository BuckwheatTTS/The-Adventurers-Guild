61-62 Procession

The Warriors cross paths with a procession of soldiers who are 
travelling to the same settlement as the Warriors. The leader 
of the procession warns that trolls and ogres are besieging 
small groups and lone travellers in this area. The Warriors can 
join the group if they pay 1D6x20 gold each or they may go 
about on their own. 

If the Warriors join the group, roll 1D6 on the table below:
 
1-2 The journey is fraught with attacking ogres and 
	ambushing Trolls but the group manages to stave off 
	each attack. The Warriors are safe but the constant 
	harassment adds another 1D3 weeks to the travel. 

3-4 The caravan must occasionally cope with attacking 
	Ogres which adds one week to the travel time.
 
5-6 The journey is safe and steady with no loss of time. 
 
	If the Warriors continue on their own, roll 1D6 on the table 
below: 

1 It isn’t long before a group of rock-throwing trolls 
	ambush the Warriors. Although they manage to 
	escape with their lives by slipping into a nearby cave, 
	they must proceed directly into the next Adventure. 

2-3 Forewarned of danger, the Warriors scout various 
	areas where they might encounter enemies. Such a 
	precaution slows them down and they must add 1D3 
	weeks to their journey. 

4-6 The Warriors manage to avoid any enemies on the 
	route without loss of time.
