15-16 Commotion

The Warriors hear a small commotion just off the main road.  
Following the voices they emerge into a small clearing. Roll 
1D6 for each Warrior and add the dice together:
 
4-8 Orcs!  The Warriors have stumbled upon a massive 
	Orc raiding party. Their only choice is to flee for their 
	lives. Lost and confused, they abandon all hope of 
	reaching a settlement. They must proceed directly 
	to the next Dungeon.
 
9-17 Bandits!  They are plotting the kidnapping of a 
	Royal nephew. After a brief battle, the Warriors 
	emerge victorious. The Warriors take the grumbling 
	leader with them to the next Settlement. Although 
	they must now add a week to their journey, they 
	are each rewarded with 1D6x50 gold for his 
	capture! 

18-24 Merchants.  The Warriors find a group of lost and 
	panicked merchants. If the Warriors escort them to 
	the next Settlement, they offer to pay each Warrior 
	1D6x100 gold upon arrival!
