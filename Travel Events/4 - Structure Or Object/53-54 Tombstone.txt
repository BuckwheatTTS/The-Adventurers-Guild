53-54 Tombstone

On the side of the road is an elaborate tombstone with one of 
the Warrior’s name engraved upon it! Each Warrior must roll 
1D6. The name on the tombstone is that of the Warrior with 
the lowest score.
 
 As the Warriors stand dumbfounded, a black-robed figure 
emerges from the shadows. The grim figure points a skeletal 
finger accusingly at the Warrior whose name whose name is 
on the tombstone. Somehow, in a previous Adventure, your 
Warrior cheated death! The Warrior must roll 1D6 below:
 
1 The cloaked figure has come to take them away. If 
	your Warrior is Battle-level 1, the skeletal figure drags 
	them away screaming in terror. If your Warrior is any 
	other Battle-level, they feel a stabbing pain in their 
	stomach. Your Warrior is -1 Toughness, -1 Strength,   
	-1 Weapon Skill  and -1 Luck until the end of  the next 
	Adventure! 

2 Your Warrior feels the life force draining away and 
	must deduct -1D3 Wounds from their Starting 
	Wounds score permanently!
 
3-4 Faced with such a stark reminder of their own 
	mortality your Warrior is -1 Willpower, -1 on their To 
	Hit rolls and -1 to all Fear and Terrors rolls during the 
	next Adventure! 

5-6 Your Warrior is sapped of energy and must deduct -1 
	Wound from their Starting Wounds score 
	permanently!
