15-16 Strange Brew

Passing through a recently abandoned campsite the Warriors 
discover a barrel marked Bugman’s Brew. Lapping a few 
drinks with the ladle to quench their thirst the Warriors soon 
discover that this is certainly not Bugman’s Brew! Each 
Warrior must roll 1D6 for on the table below: 

1 The brew makes your Warrior feel horribly sick and 
	they lose 1 Wound permanently.
 
2 The brew makes your Warrior feel weak and they are -
	1 Strength for the next Adventure.
 
3 The brew causes your Warrior to fall ill. The group 
	must add one week to their journey as their comrade 
	slows them down. (Add one week for each Warrior 
	who rolls this result.) 

4 Your Warrior becomes befuddled and disoriented and 
	spends the next hour frolicking among the flowers 
	singing songs. 

5 Your Warrior has a mind-altering experience as they 
	face their deepest fear. They may add +1 to all Fear 
	rolls and +2 to all Terror rolls in the next Adventure.
  
6 Your Warrior’s muscles bulge and they feel more 
	powerful than ever before! They are +1 Strength for 
	the next Adventure! Roll another 1D6 and if the result 
	is a 6, then the addition is permanent!
