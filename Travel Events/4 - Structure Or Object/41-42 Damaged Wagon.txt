41-42 Damaged Wagon

The Warriors come across a broken-down wagon that looks to 
have been discarded on the side of the road. The Warriors may 
attempt to fix the wagon and use it to reduce their travel time 
to the next Settlement.
 
1 No matter how hard they try, the Warriors are unable 
	to get the pile of wreckage to function as the wagon it 
	once was. The Warriors spend so much time and 
	energy trying to repair it that their journey time is 
	extended by two weeks. 

2 The wagon proves to be more trouble than it is worth 
	and the Warriors properly abandon it by the side of the 
	road. The time spent trying to fix it adds one week to 
	their journey.
 
3-4 The Warriors manage to make the wagon operational 
	but it repeatedly breaks down and the Warriors save 
	no time on their journey this week. For each additional 
	week they travel with the wagon, the Warriors must 
	roll for a Travelling Hazard as normal but must also roll 
	on this table until they obtain a different result.
 
5 The Warriors are able to fix the wagon and their 
	journey time to the next Settlement is reduced by one 
	week! Unfortunately, the wagon falls apart just as they 
	reach the Settlement gates. There is no possibility to 
	repair it and it must be discarded immediately.
 
6 The Warriors restore the wagon into excellent 
	condition. Their journey time to the next Settlement is 
	reduced by two weeks! 
 
The Warriors may keep the wagon as their own and it 
will knock 2 weeks off their journey to any Settlement. 
But as long as they have it, they must roll 1D6 each 
time they reach a Settlement. If the score is a 6, the 
owner of the wagon has discarded it as junk and the 
Warriors no longer have to roll for the wagon when 
they reach a Settlement. But if the result is a 1, the 
wagon was reported stolen and authorities arrest the 
Warriors for theft. They are thrown into jail for 1D3 
days and fined 1D6x25 gold each and the wagon is 
returned to its rightly owner.
