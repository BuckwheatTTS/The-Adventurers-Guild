11-12 Tower

The Warriors spy a tower in the distance with a lone window 
near the top. They hear the calls of a fair maiden but they 
cannot find any way to enter the structure.
 
If the Warriors have a rope then they can rescue the damsel 
but it will be lost in the process (discard it).
 
When then Warrior reach the next Settlement, roll 1D6. On a 
score of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 they are rewarded for rescuing the 
burgomeister’s missing daughter. The Warriors receive 
1D6x100 gold to be shared equally between them. If the score 
is a 1, however, the woman accuses the Warriors of 
kidnapping her and they are thrown into prison for 1D6 days 
and fined 1D6x25 per Battle-level gold each!
