61-62 Shrine

The Warriors make their way through a thicket and stumble 
across an old shrine. A stone well sits in the middle of the 
shrine with a cracked ornate tablet hanging above it. A plaque 
reads: “Part with your wealth and gain enlightenment.” 

A Warrior may throw 1D6x100 gold into the well one time, 
whereupon it mysteriously vanishes and the Warrior may 
make roll on the following table:
 
1-2 The Warrior gains no knowledge. 

3 The Warrior receives insight into a concept of efficient 
	movement, gaining +1 Initiative for the next Dungeon. 

4 The Warrior understands the relationship between a 
	Warrior and their weapon. They gain +1 Weapon Skill 
	or Ballistic Skill for the next Dungeon. 
 
5 The Warrior feels a resolve deep in their soul. They 
	are +1 Toughness for the next Dungeon. 

6 The Warrior sees a glimpse of enlightenment in the 
	waters of the well. They are +1 Luck for the next 
	Adventure.
