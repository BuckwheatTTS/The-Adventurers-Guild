35-36 Monolith

In the middle of the forest, the Warriors come upon a huge 
stone monolith; its origin unknown and its purpose 
unfathomable. The monolith hums with awesome power and a   
sudden flash of light blinds the Warriors causing them to 
topple backward. When they regain their feet they find 
themselves imbued with magical power. 

During the next Adventure each Warrior may choose to add 
+2 to a single Power Phase roll, although an Unexpected 
Event still occurs on a roll of 1. Only one Warrior may use this 
ability at any one time – it is not cumulative. Once used, this 
ability is gone forever.
