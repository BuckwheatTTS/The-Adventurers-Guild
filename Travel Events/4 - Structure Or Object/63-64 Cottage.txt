63-64 Cottage

The Warriors stray off the main road and happen upon an 
abandoned stone cottage. The interior is quaint and furnished 
with chairs and even beds. The Warriors are so elated to find a 
comfortable place to rest that they find it hard to leave the 
place. The Warriors decide to relax and enjoy the comfort of 
the cottage, adding one week to their journey. They are well-
rested, however, and each of them may add +1 to their 
Willpower until the end of the next Adventure.
