21-22 Dungeon Map

The Warriors take refuge for a night in an abandoned keep, its 
walls crumbling and its halls long since plundered. Among the 
debris, one of the Warriors (determined randomly) notices a 
battered but still locked iron box. Breaking open the age-old 
lock proves easy enough and inside the Warrior finds, what 
appears to be the map of a dungeon. Although faded, part of 
the map is still clearly visible. 

At the start of the next Dungeon, the Warrior with the map 
may look at (and lay out on the table) the top six cards of the 
Dungeon Deck, forewarned as they are of what is to come.
