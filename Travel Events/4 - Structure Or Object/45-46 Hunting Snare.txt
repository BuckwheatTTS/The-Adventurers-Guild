45-46 Hunting Snare

Trudging through the wilderness, one of the Warriors 
(determine randomly) inadvertently steps into a foot noose.  In 
the blink of an eye, the foot noose hauls the Warrior high up 
into a tree. They can easily cut their foot loose but the 
resulting fall would be fatal!
 
One of the other Warriors will have to try and catch their 
unfortunate companion. The Warriors may either decide 
amongst themselves or draw lots (determine randomly) to see 
who will attempt the catch. Once a catcher has been chosen, 
the suspended Warrior cuts the cord holding them aloft and 
plummets towards their wide-eyed comrade. The catcher must 
roll 2D6 and add their Strength and their Initiative. 

If the score is less than 16, the ensuing impact is as much 
comical as it is alarming. Both Warriors are -1D3 Wounds to 
start the next Adventure which can be healed by normal 
means. If a double ‘1’ is rolled, however, the catch goes 
terribly wrong and both Warriors must deduct -1D3 Wounds 
from their Starting Wounds score permanently. 

If the total score is 16+, the crazy idea worked and both 
Warriors end up with nothing more than minor bumps and 
bruises.
