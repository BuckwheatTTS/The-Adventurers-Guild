51-52 Toll Station

The Warriors attempt to cross into a new area but are stopped 
by the local militia who insist that each Warrior pay 5 gold for 
each item of Equipment and Treasure that they are carrying. 
The Warrior must sell Equipment and Treasure if necessary. If 
they cannot pay, the guards take as much as they have before 
letting them pass.
