65-66 Portal

Trekking across a shallow stream the Warriors see an ancient 
stone archway covered in moss and vines. As they pass 
through the structure the Warriors promptly disappear, 
rematerialising near a stream that they’ve never seen before. 
After checking their map with the surrounding landmarks, 
they determine that they are somehow closer to their 
destination than they were before. The archway portal that 
they came through is nowhere to be seen but their journey is 
reduced by one week. 

 Each Warrior must roll 1D6 and if the score is a ‘1’ it means 
that one of the Warrior’s items of Equipment or Treasure 
(determined randomly) did not make it through with them. 
Discard it immediately.
