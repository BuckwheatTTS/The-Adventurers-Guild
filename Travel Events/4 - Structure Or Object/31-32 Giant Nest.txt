31-32 Giant Nest

The Warriors catch sight of colourful birds or enormous size 
taking flight from a nearby crag. Reckoning that the eggs of 
such birds might fetch a pretty price, the Warriors wonder 
about finding their nests. Each Warrior who wishes to try and 
find a nest before the giant birds return may roll 1D6 and add 
their Initiative. If the total is 8 or more the Warrior has 
successfully navigated the crag and found some eggs! The 
Warrior finds 1D6 giant eggs which may be sold at a 
Settlement for 1D3x100 gold pieces each.
 
If none of the Warriors score 8 or more, then the giant birds 
returns aggressively, forcing them to continue on their way.
