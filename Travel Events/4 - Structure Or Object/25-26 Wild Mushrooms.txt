25-26 Wild Mushrooms

The Warriors discover a patch of wild mushrooms which they 
can pick and dry in the sun as they travel. When they reach 
the next Settlement each Warrior can make 1D6 special 
provisions from the dried mushrooms. Keep those provisions 
separate from any others. 

When consumed, each mushroom provision heals 1D6 
Wounds but if you roll a ‘1’ then your Warrior begins to 
hallucinate believing that they are surrounded by evil 
creatures. In a wild panic they lash out all around and every 
model adjacent to your Warrior suffers 1D3 Wounds with no 
modifiers for anything. 

The mushroom provisions never spoil.
