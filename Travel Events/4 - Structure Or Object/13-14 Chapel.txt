13-14 Chapel

The Warriors see a small chapel. If you wish, your Warrior may 
spend some time in prayer to their gods. After your Warrior 
spends 1D6x20 gold per Battle-level in offerings you may roll 
1D6 on the following table:
 
1-3 The gods aren’t listening, and ignore your Warrior.
 
4-6 Your Warrior has +1 Wounds added to their Starting 
	Wounds score. This is a permanent addition. 
 
Each Warrior may make one prayer and then must move on.
