43-44 Death Note

Slumped against the trunk of an old tree sits the sad remains 
of a once proud warrior with a crumpled note clutched in his 
cold, dead hand. The note is the last will of the warrior, 
evidently written they were dying, and it reveals that the 
warrior was betrayed by one of their comrades over some 
treasure they had stashed following a recent adventure. 
Although the note details the location of the treasure, such a 
detour would add an additional 1D3 weeks to the Warriors’ 
current journey.
 
If the Warriors decide to go after the treasure, roll on the 
following table: 

1 The Warriors find the treasure location, but when they 
	pull the rocks aside to claim it, they find nothing! 
	Someone has beaten them to it! 

2-3 The Warriors find the treasure in a buried chest. Far 
	from fabulous, the Warriors find 1D6 x 25 gold each. 

4-5 The Warriors’ search ends in an abandoned cottage. In 
	a floorboard, just as the note indicated, one of the 
	Warriors (determine randomly) finds a gleaming an 
	item of Objective Room Treasure! 

6 The Warriors find themselves in a secret glade. In a 
	nearby hidden cave, just as the note explained, the 
	Warriors discover treasure! Each Warrior receives one 
	item of Objective Room Treasure!
