31-32 Famine

On the Warriors’ travels, they pass through lands cursed by 
famine and drought. Being the worthy hero that they are, each 
Warrior gives the poverty stricken peasants a proportion of 
their gold. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior on the following table:
 
1-2 Your Warrior gives any one item of treasure to the 
peasants. 

3 Your Warrior gives 100 gold to the poor.
 
4-5 Your Warrior gives 1D6x10 gold to the poor. 

6 Touched by your kindness and concern, the village 
	elder brings a carefully wrapped sword out of his 
	house, presenting it to your Warrior in exchange for 
	1D6x50 gold. 
 
	The magical blade is a Sword of Sharpness, and each time it 
is used is causes +2 Wounds on any Monster it hits.
 
	However, the sword can never be sold, as any attempt to 
get rid of it results in it mysteriously finding its way back to 
the village. 

	If more than one player rolls a 6, draw a Warrior counter to 
determine whose Warrior gets the sword and roll again for the 
other Warriors.
