11-12 Avalanche

The path to the Settlement takes the Warriors between two 
large, snow-covered mountains. Upon reaching the canyon, 
the Warriors come across a small Village. The locals notify the 
Warriors that the route beyond has been cut off by a recent 
avalanche. The Warriors’ journey ends here as they lose all 
hope of making it to a town or city.
