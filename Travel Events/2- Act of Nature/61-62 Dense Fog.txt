61-62 Dense Fog

While the Warriors are crossing a steep ridge, a dense fog 
quickly descends into the area. If the Warriors circumvent the 
fog, they must add one week to their journey.
 
If they decide to continue through the dangerous fog, they 
must roll 1D6 on the table below:
 
1 The Warriors emerge from the foggy ridge in front of a 
	Village and discover that they have been travelling in 
	the wrong direction! Their journey has ended. 

2 One of the Warriors (determined randomly) nearly falls 
	off the ridge. Another Warrior pulls them to safety but 
	one of the falling Warrior’s belongings (your choice) 
	plunges into the gully below and out of sight. Roll on 
	this table again. 

3-4 The fog is thick and the Warriors proceed cautiously 
	along the ridge. Roll on this table again. 

5 The fog eventually lifts and the Warriors manage to 
	cross the ridge without further incident. 

6 The Warriors cross the ridge and when the fog lifts 
	they can see a city in the distance! They may stop here 
	or continue on to their original destination.
