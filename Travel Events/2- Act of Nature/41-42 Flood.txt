41-42 Flood

The weather has been bad recently and the land for miles 
around has flooded, creating an impassable lake. The Warriors 
can either abandon any hope they have of reaching their 
destination, in which case they must go straight into the next 
Adventure, or pay 20 gold each to a ferryman to take them 
across the obstruction.
