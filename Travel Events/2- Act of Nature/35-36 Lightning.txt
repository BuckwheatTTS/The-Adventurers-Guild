35-36 Lightning

As the Warriors are setting up camp on the top of a hill, a 
storm gathers above them. The sky blackens and grows dim, 
and thunder rolls. The next instant a lighting bolt streaks from 
the sky, hitting one of the Warriors on the head.
 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score 
is hit by lightning, melting their armour. They lose two items of 
armour (a shield and a helmet, for instance). If the Warrior 
doesn’t have two items of armour, the armour they do wear is 
melted, and the lightning bolt sets their clothes alight too – 
they arrive at the next Settlement in tattered, charred rags 
and must therefore buy new robes and new boots.
