43-44 Hail Storm

Chunks of ice the size of bird eggs bombard the Warriors as 
they walk along the road. They flee for cover in a dilapidated 
cottage but in their haste, each Warrior drops one item of 
Dungeon Room Treasure. When the storm finally ends the 
Warriors retrieve the item. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior to see 
what state the item is in: 

1-3 The hail has damaged the item beyond repair. Discard 
	it immediately. 

4-6 The item has suffered no damage from the hail.
