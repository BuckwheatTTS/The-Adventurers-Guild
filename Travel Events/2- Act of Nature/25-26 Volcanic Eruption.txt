25-26 Volcanic Eruption

Travelling through a Mountain pass, the Warriors are shaken 
violently by a thunderous explosion. From the sky fall chunks 
of molten lava! As the area is sprayed with volcanic fire and 
ash the Warriors are pelted and smothered. Each Warrior must 
roll 1D6 and add their Toughness and Armour. If the score is 
less than 8, the Warrior is scalded and burned badly, and must 
deduct -1 from the Starting Wounds score permanently. In 
addition, the group must flee the area, thus adding one week 
to their journey.
