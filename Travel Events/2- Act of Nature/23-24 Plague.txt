 
23-24 Plague

The Warriors arrive at a large town in the grip of a terrible 
plague. All roads, bar the one the Warriors entered by, are 
blocked. Their journey is over and they must now either go 
straight into the next Adventure, or they may stay in the 
afflicted town. 

If the Warriors stay, use the normal rules to determine what 
they do there (see the Settlement section), but each time a 
Warrior makes a roll on any table for any reason your must 
make roll another 1D6 on the following table: 

1 The Warrior contracts the plague. They are at -1 
	Strength for the duration of the next Dungeon. 
2 The Warrior contracts the plague. They are at -1 
	Toughness for the duration of the next Dungeon. 
3-6 The Warrior remains unaffected by the plague – for 
	now! 
 
Once a Warrior has rolled a 1 or 2 on the table above, they 
need not roll on the table for the rest of their stay in the 
Plague Town.
