45-46 Drought

The days become hotter and hotter and no rain falls from the 
sky. Water holes are empty upon arrival and streams have 
dried up in the surrounding area. Each Warrior must roll 1D6 
below: 

1 Your Warrior is severely dehydrated and their throat 
	feels like a raging fire. They collapse often and their 
	companions must frequently carry them thus adding 1 
	week to the journey (cumulative with other Warriors 
	who roll result 1 & 2). In addition, the Warrior must 
	deduct -1 Wound permanently from their Starting 
	Wounds score permanently. 

2 Your Warrior does everything they can to trudge 
	onward but slows the group down by 1 week 
	(cumulative with other Warriors who roll result 1 & 2.) 

3-5 Your Warrior is occasionally overwhelmed. Although 
	they are parched and their skin blistered, they press 
	onward. 

6 Your Warrior wills themself to continue. When they 
	emerge from the drought, they are much stronger. 
	Your Warrior permanently adds +1 to their Starting 
	Wounds score!
