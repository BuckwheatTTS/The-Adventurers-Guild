21-22 Tornado

The Warriors are resting when a tornado unexpectedly tears 
through their camp. The winds are ferocious and the Warriors 
have to fight to prevent being sucked up and blown away.
 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and look up the lowest number 
rolled on the following table to determine what happened to 
the Warrior with that score. If two or more Warriors have the 
same score, re-roll until the victim is determined. 

1 Unable to resist, your Warrior is sucked up high into 
	the air before crashing back to the ground. They must 
	be carried to safety by the other Warriors, adding one 
	week to the journey time. As soon as the party arrives 
	at its destination, the Warrior must pay 100 gold to be 
	healed. If the injured Warrior cannot afford it, the 
	healer takes all the gold they do have plus one piece of 
	Equipment or Treasure as payment. 

2 Desperately clinging to a large boulder, your Warrior 
	only keeps their grip by lightening the weight of their 
	coin purse by 1D6x50 gold. 

3-6 Your Warrior resists the howling winds but at a cost as 
	a weapon is plucked from their grasp. Discard any one 
	of your Warrior’s weapons.
