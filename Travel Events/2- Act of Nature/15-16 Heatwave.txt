15-16 Heatwave

This region is in the grip of an unprecedented heatwave and 
the Warriors are only able to travel at night which adds 2 more 
weeks to their journey. 
 
	At the beginning of every week until they reach a 
Settlement, each Warrior must roll 1D6. If the result is a 1, the 
Warrior must deduct -1 Wound from their Starting Wounds 
score permanently. If they ever reach zero Starting Wounds, 
they are dead and removed from the game.
